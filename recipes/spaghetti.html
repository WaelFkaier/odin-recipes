    <p>
      This is an Italian-style pasta sauce with homemade meatballs that's cooked slowly over low heat for an intense tomato flavor. 
      It's easy to make the spaghetti sauce ahead of time; 
      gently reheat and add meatballs 30 minutes before you're ready to serve with your favorite pasta.
